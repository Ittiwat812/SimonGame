# SimonGame
This project is a basic implementation of the Simon game, consisting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The HTML structure defines the game layout with colored buttons. JavaScript handles game logic, including starting the game on keypress, registering button clicks, comparing user input with the game sequence, advancing levels, and handling game over situations. Additionally, it incorporates jQuery for DOM manipulation and audio playback. CSS styles the game elements, providing visual enhancements and animations. Overall, this project offers a hands-on introduction to web development concepts, demonstrating event handling, DOM manipulation, and styling techniques in a fun and interactive way through the classic Simon game.

Special thanks to Dr. Angela Yu for source code and her invaluable guidance and expertise in providing this insightful lesson on how to implement this project, sourced from 'The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp'. Thank you, Dr. Angela!"
